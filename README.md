📌 Improving Data Accuracy in CRM using AI

📖 Introduction

Customer Relationship Management (CRM) systems store vast amounts of customer data. However, inconsistencies, missing values, and duplicate records often reduce data reliability. This project leverages Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques to clean, validate, and enhance CRM data quality. The final result is a structured, high-quality dataset that businesses can confidently use for decision-making.

🚀 Project Workflow

Model Development and Evaluation

🛠 Step 1: Advanced Data Cleaning

✅ Handling Missing Values: Used AI-driven imputation (mean/mode) for numerical and categorical attributes.✅ Outlier Detection: Implemented Isolation Forest to identify and remove anomalies.✅ Duplicate Removal & Standardization: Removed redundant records and standardized key data fields (e.g., phone numbers, email formatting).

🤖 Step 2: Model Building and Training

✔ Baseline Model – Decision Tree: Quick classification model for initial evaluation.✔ Advanced Model – Random Forest: Enhanced model performance with hyperparameter tuning.✔ AI-Driven Data Validation: Used K-Means clustering to detect and validate potential duplicates.

📊 Step 3: Data Visualization & Insights

📌 Heatmaps to visualize missing data.📌 Histograms for customer age distribution analysis.📌 Clustering Insights to categorize and validate CRM records.

🏆 Step 4: Model Evaluation
